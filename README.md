# Create a Counter Component with State Management

## Author: Katrina Hill

### Description
This is a React application that demonstrates the use of state management and functions to modify a counter value. It includes multiple buttons with different behaviors for incrementing the counter.

### Features
- **Increment**: Increments the counter by 1 immediately.
- **Increment After Delay**: Increments the counter by 1 after a 2-second delay.
- **Increment Twice**: Attempts to increment the counter by 2 twice (incorrect behavior due to how state updates in React).
- **Correct Increment Twice**: Correctly increments the counter by 2 using the previous state value.

### Files
- **Counter.js**: Contains the `Counter` component with the counter logic and buttons for interaction.
- **App.js**: Renders the `Counter` component and displays the app UI.
- **App.test.js**: 

### How to Run
